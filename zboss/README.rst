ZBOSS Zigbee stack
##################

The |NCS|'s :ref:`nrf:ug_zigbee` stack uses ZBOSS â€“ a portable, high-performance Zigbee software protocol stack that allows for interoperability, customizing, testing, and optimizing of your Zigbee solution.

The nrfxlib repository contains a set of precompiled ZBOSS libraries.
The libraries fully conform to the certification, but they are not necessarily certified.

For information about additional configuration of these libraries and their certification status, see :ref:`zboss_configuration`.
For detailed documentation of the ZBOSS API for these versions and instructions on how to use it, see `ZBOSS API documentation`_.
